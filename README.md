# Do-Not-Read-Me

In code's repository, dark and deep it lies,
A realm of bugs, where darkness oft belies,
Only those keen, with eagle eyes and wits,
Shall find the treasure hidden in its pits.

These cryptic flaws, like secrets in the night,
Concealed from view, they elude the light.
Yet, those who seek, with diligence and grace,
May glimpse the soul of errors, in this place.

For in this world of code, a treasure's cast,
A prize unique, that none can get too fast.
With patience and resolve, the truth unfolds,
As programmers seek the gems in countless codes.

So, brave the challenge, venture forth, and see,
The hidden treasure in the code's decree.
For in the bugs, a world of knowledge waits,
To those who dare to open error's gates.
