# Do-Not-Read-Me

In code's repository, dark and deep it lies,<br>
A realm of bugs, where darkness oft belies,<br>
Only those keen, with eagle eyes and wits,<br>
Shall find the treasure hidden in its pits.<br>

These cryptic flaws, like secrets in the night,<br>
Concealed from view, they elude the light.<br>
Yet, those who seek, with diligence and grace,<br>
May glimpse the soul of errors, in this place.<br>

For in this world of code, a treasure's cast,<br>
A prize unique, that none can get too fast.<br>
With patience and resolve, the truth unfolds,<br>
As programmers seek the gems in countless codes.<br>

So, brave the challenge, venture forth, and see,<br>
The hidden treasure in the code's decree.<br>
For in the bugs, a world of knowledge waits,<br>
To those who dare to open error's gates.<br>
